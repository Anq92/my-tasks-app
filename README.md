# Introduction

This repo contains a code for task management application UI created in educational purposes.  
The main goal of this project was to learn Typescript and working with API.  
It wasn't copied from any tutorial :smirk:.

This application was created only to test some front-end programming skills, so it's not completely functional and it doesn't store the data you enter in any database. It works with an API created by my mentor, so I could practice HTTP requests. The data is sent to the external server, but stored only in temporary memory and will disappear after some time.

You can run this application locally(use [instructions](#installation)) or test it online [here](https://anq92.github.io/my-tasks-app/).
